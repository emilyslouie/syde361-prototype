      <h2>What is sleep and why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
        Sleep is a mandatory state of rest designed to restore energy and
        wellbeing. Sleep is responsible for brain health through memory storage,
        clearing out toxins, and allowing the brain to recover from stress as
        well as body health, impacting growth, hormones, and the immune system
        [1][2][3]. It has been shown that not getting enough sleep at night can
        be detrimental to both physical and mental health, leading to higher
        risk of obesity, heart disease, and decreased focus [3]. Since sleep
        serves as the foundation for our wellbeing, it's important that we get a
        good night's sleep every night.
      </p>
      <h2>What are some factors that affect sleep?</h2>
      <p>
        Light is a major contributing factor to a complete sleep and well-rested
        person. One article states, “natural daylight…has previously been shown
        to…improve sleep quality… [and] each additional hour spent outdoors
        advanced sleep by ~30 min” [4]. However, “later exposure to light >10
        lux had more nocturnal awakenings” [4]. This means that any light
        greater than 10 lux (1 lumen/m2) while sleeping would cause worse
        sleeping conditions and therefore contribute to a shorter sleep duration
        and poorer sleep quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Temperature and humidity are two other major contributing factors to
        one's sleep. A study on Turkish university students showed that room
        scents, including humidity, caused poorer sleep in 53.1% of participants
        [5]. In another study, it showed that 24.8 degrees celsius was the most
        comfortable temperature for participants, meaning that any large
        incremental differences above or below this temperature would cause a
        change in sleep [6].
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 36px; margin-bottom: 36px">
        To better understand the relationship between these environmental
        factors and sleep, a week of data collection was conducted.
        Environmental conditions including light, temperature, and humidity,
        were collected during one's sleep, as well as recording self-reported
        moods before and after rest, and overall sleep duration. The data that
        was collected for an individual is presented below.

          Looking back at the night, they slept for 8.1 hours. The average light
          levels were 0.08 lux and was a high of 0.712 lux in the room. The
          room's average temperature was 23.3°C, average humidity was 50.6%, and
          the average humidex was 26.3°C. If any of these values seem above or
          below the overall average, they are possible factors that could have
          affected the overall sleep.
