# SYDE 361 - DV Option 3

This is one of three data visualization options done as part of SYDE 361 during spring 2022 by Group 2. This includes Abby Chan, Adam Linton, Aidan Bowers, Emily Louie, and Keaton Lees.

This option displays all of the information in on a single page. Each day is separated by individual cards to group the data. A summary of the analyzed data is written to introduce each day's worth of data. Two charts, one for light and one for humidex, display data for each day, and are accompanied by a user-inputted mood before and after sleeping.

### How to run the prototype

Open the `index.html` file in your browser and the prototype should be loaded within a few seconds. A PDF of the print screen is included just in case.
