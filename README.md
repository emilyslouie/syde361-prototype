# SYDE 361 - Group 2 Prototypes

The three data visualization options done as part of SYDE 361 during spring 2022 by Group 2. This includes Abby Chan, Adam Linton, Aidan Bowers, Emily Louie, and Keaton Lees.

The aim of the project was to:

> Design and test a personal environmental monitoring system and data visualization/storytelling experience aimed at educating engineering students about their relationship to the environments they experience as a student.

This repository houses the three data visualization prototypes done. They utilize plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that it runs on any computer. Each prototype can be accessed by opening the `index.html` file in each of the folders.
