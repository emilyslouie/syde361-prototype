# SYDE 361 - Group 2 Prototypes

The three data visualization options done as part of SYDE 361 during spring 2022 by Group 2. This includes Abby Chan, Adam Linton, Aidan Bowers, Emily Louie, and Keaton Lees.

The aim of the project was to:

> Design and test a personal environmental monitoring system and data visualization/storytelling experience aimed at educating engineering students about their relationship to the environments they experience as a student.

This repository houses the three data visualization prototypes done. They utilize plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that it runs on any computer. Each prototype can be accessed by opening the `index.html` file in each of the folders.

### DV Option 1

This option displays the information in the form of a calendar. Each day in the calendar is summarized by the sleep quality rating determined by the user's input. More information about the specific night's sleep can be accessed by clicking the "Learn more" button which toggles a card which displays average information and short text-based summary analyzing the data collected.

### DV Option 2

This option also displays the information in the form of a calendar. Each day in the calendar has the average humidex, temperature, humidity, and light displayed in the cell. More granular information about the specific night's sleep can be accessed by clicking the "Learn more button" which toggles a card which displays line graphs of each environmental factor over the course of the night.

### DV Option 3

This option displays all of the information in on a single page. Each day is separated by individual cards to group the data. A summary of the analyzed data is written to introduce each day's worth of data. Two charts, one for light and one for humidex, display data for each day, and are accompanied by a user-inputted mood before and after sleeping.
