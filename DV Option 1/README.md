# SYDE 361 - DV Option 1

This is one of three data visualization options done as part of SYDE 361 during spring 2022 by Group 2. This includes Abby Chan, Adam Linton, Aidan Bowers, Emily Louie, and Keaton Lees.

This option displays the information in the form of a calendar. Each day in the calendar is summarized by the sleep quality rating determined by the user's input. More information about the specific night's sleep can be accessed by clicking the "Learn more" button which toggles a card which displays average information and short text-based summary analyzing the data collected.

### How to run the prototype

Open the `index.html` file in your browser and the prototype should be loaded within a few seconds. A PDF of the print screen is included just in case.
